# Portfolio
## Description

Welcome to my mock-up portfolio designed for potential hiring managers. Crafting this web-based portfolio aims to simplify the process for hiring managers to explore my professional background. The digital format not only facilitates seamless navigation but also allows for direct links to my various projects.

**Key Features**:

* **About Me**: Discover insights into my background and professional journey.
* **Projects**: Dive into a showcase of my notable projects and accomplishments.
* **Contact Information**: Find convenient ways to get in touch with me.

**Design Philosophy**: 
My objective in developing this site was to strike a balance between readability and a unique representation of my personal style. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in creating responsive websites and mastering the utilization of flexbox for optimal design.

Feel free to explore, and thank you for considering my portfolio!
